        <p class="box-shadow" style="color:white">The history of gaming can be traced back to the early 1950s when
            computer scientists began
            developing simple
            games and simulations on mainframe computers. In the 1960s and 1970s, arcade games like Pong and Space
            Invaders
            became popular, and in the 1980s, home gaming consoles like Atari and Nintendo brought gaming into people's
            living rooms.
            <br />
            The 1990s saw the rise of the first-person shooter genre with games like Doom and Quake, while the 2000s
            introduced massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft. The 2010s saw a proliferation of
            mobile
            gaming and the rise of esports as a legitimate competitive activity.
            <br />
            Today, the gaming industry is a multi-billion dollar global business, with advancements in technology like
            virtual reality and augmented reality expanding the possibilities for immersive gaming experiences.
